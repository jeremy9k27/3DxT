# 3DxT
Introducing ‘3 Dimensional’ Expected Threat (3DxT) 

**Intro**
This novel stat is based on Sarah Rudd's xT, assigning a value to each grid location on the pitch. Essentialy, the value of a grid is the probability of the team in possession scoring if the ball is in that grid. 3DxT incorporates defender positioning to xT, adding a new level of highly important context.

Of course, on the pitch, the grids are still 2D. However, the intution of this stat becomes 3 Dimesnional because the height of the defensive line becomes a new input/dimenson. The visualization (as seen below), is a rectangular prism.
